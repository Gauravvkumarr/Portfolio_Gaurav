Build a fully functional and responsive personal portfolio website using React (JavaScript).

Requirements:

The website should be clean, minimal, and professional — no funky or pinchy colors.

Use a modern color palette with soft gradients (like navy blue, slate gray, white, light cyan, or pastel purple).

Include smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion or CSS transitions.

The site should be dynamic — data (like projects, skills, and achievements) should come from a JSON or state file so it’s easy to update later.

Use React Router for navigation between sections/pages.

Sections to Include:

Home – Introduction, name, tagline, and a short bio with a call-to-action (e.g., “View My Work”).

About Me – Personal details, academic background, and interests.

Projects – Display at least 4 projects dynamically with title, tech stack, short description, and GitHub/demo links.

Achievements – Cards or timeline of key achievements or certifications.

Experience – Timeline view showing company/organization, role, and duration.

Contact – A working contact form (name, email, message) that sends data via EmailJS or a backend API. Include clickable social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.).

Footer – Copyright text with dynamic current year.

Technical Stack:

React (JavaScript)

Tailwind CSS or Styled Components for styling

Framer Motion for animations

React Router for navigation

Optional: EmailJS for contact form functionality

Design Expectations:

Clean, grid-based layout with balanced whitespace.

Subtle hover effects, fade-ins, and slide animations.

Use Google Fonts (e.g., Poppins, Inter, or Lato) for typography.

Responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Consistent spacing and color hierarchy across all sections.

Deliverables:

A complete React project with proper folder structure:

src/
├── components/
├── pages/
├── assets/
├── data/
├── App.js
└── index.js


Include example data in a data.js file for easy updates.

Include comments explaining animation logic and reusable components.

Optional Add-Ons:

Add a “Scroll to Top” floating button.

Add light/dark theme toggle using context or Zustand.

Add meta tags and SEO optimization (React Helmet).
